# My portafolio
Here is the design of my web portfolio made entirely in [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/), the style of the page is minimalist, the color palette I used is [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

## Design
This website has a minimalist style and is inspired by two designs made by [TheLinuxCast](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLinuxCast) and [LinuxChad](https://www.youtube.com/@LinuxChad). The web pages are as follows:
